How will 2019 fare when it comes to property management? Let’s find out today.

Here’s our forecast for the 2019 real estate market in regard to property management:

**When we talk property management, we’re mostly referring to apartments.** We’ve seen about five years of increasing apartment inventory in the San Antonio market. A lot of these apartments are being absorbed, as well. We’ve seen a vacancy rate of 7.6%.&nbsp;

Apartment prices have increased by 3.6%, which is great. The higher the increase in prices, the more we get when we rent out residential houses. And we’re seeing a few things happening when it comes to residential houses: **The number of homes rented has increased by 5% and leasing rates have increased by 1.4%.** This may seem low, but as absorption rates and vacancies decrease, we should see prices increase to around 5%.

These changes are spurred on by wages, which have increased by 3.2%. That’s the highest increase in a decade. On top of this, interest rates are not expected to increase until June. **These are two great reasons to start thinking about investing if you haven’t already.** If you plan on getting a loan later, it’s going to be a lot more expensive. The average home price in our area has increased by 8%, so investors can look forward to increased rental amounts.
